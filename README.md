Also uploaded here are our two different data sets the airports and flight times the airports one was used to make the observables map and the flights was used in our Jupiter code.

These were are four questions:
1.The question we wanted to ask was could we get a mapped visualization of all the airports.
2.What can we learn from the data of the most and least popular airports?
3.Are there effects we can read from the data about months and years 
4.What are the busiest and least busiest routes?
