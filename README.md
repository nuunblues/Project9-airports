# Project9-airports
This is our project 9 repository with are Jupiter notebook and links to the observable.
This is the link to our observable which includes the world map visualization and the 3D rotating globe visualization.

Also uploaded here are our two different data sets the airports and flight times the airports one was used to make the observables map and the flights was used in our Jupiter code. Our flight data is from Kaggle who got it from the US international air passenger and freight statistics report. The other is from GitHub from openflight.org.

These were are four questions:

1.The question we wanted to ask was could we get a mapped visualization of all the airports.

2.What can we learn from the data of the most and least popular airports?

3.Are there effects we can read from the data about months and years 

4.What are the busiest and least busiest routes?

5.Some sort or interactive elements  for above and beyond?

Our above and beyond was are 3D rotating globe visulazation as we think its a cool fun interactive part.
